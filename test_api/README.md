# Test API docker config
This configuration is used for instantiating an instance of the Solar Forecast
Arbiter API, complete with a mysql instance including all of the data found in
the api's `datastore` directory.

For the build to succeed, the api codebase must be cloned here. This is usually
taken care of by the CI/azure pipelines configuration.
